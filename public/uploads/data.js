Just lik<span style=\"color: rgb(0 0 0/var(--tw-text-opacity));\">e Alice in Wonderland, I was both confused and confounded, of whether or not to start writing in a platform where all my thoughts were&nbsp; public. I was unsure of where or what to create. But then I began to think of those who believed in me.

Here, I shall share the finest of my experiences, from being the most nurtured single girl-child of my family to what I call a darling-kid of my neighborhood. The crux of my content will mostly be on my day-to-day life as a medical student, and how I navigate through the academic challenges in basic science, the irresistible smell of dissection hall, the dizziness of clinical rotation, the blues and pinks of pathology, and the bonds you constantly make and break. MBBS starts hovering around you when you get jealous of bony tibial tuberosities because they've got some real attachments, but you don't.

Having seen some perfectly happy-looking twenty-year-old medical students , trembling on the brink of collapse , I'm writing about a major risk factor that's mentioned nowhere in our beloved father Robbins.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dx: Overthinking</strong></p><p><strong>Risk factor: Predisposition to campus politics</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><div classname=\"w-3/4 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto my-3 lg:my-5 drop-shadow-sm\">\n            <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dww0rxb4q/image/upload/v1684083441/notes/wetpa86tcuvk1bcax4nm.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n            <div classname=\"text-center\">\n              <p><br></p>\n            </div>\n          </div><p>Recently, I felt agitated and restless, prompting me to ponder what made me anxious, when I have this perfectly balanced life full of happiness, satisfaction, and self-love.</p><p>\"Reading those big medical texts must be really fascinating,hai didi ?\",I was dumbfounded when I received this query from a 15-years old.</p><p>Well, what can I say? I started questioning myself if studying medicine was worth the sea of trouble we go through.</p><p><br></p><p>With her text, I began analyzing the one-and-a-half years I spent at this campus. \"Is medicine fulfilling?\" In LMICs like Nepal, parents expect you to earn by your early twenties, but you see your seniors struggling to have a well-settled career till their late-thirties. That's why most medical students in their early years spend their days rampantly learning hard skills and searching for freelancing options. Very few succeed in grabbing them, while most give up upon the first step of skill-learning because of the due assignments and the haphazardly hectic schedules they have ,making them end up with designing mountain out of a molehill.</p><p><br></p><p>A student enrolled in medical college o<span style=\"color: rgb(0 0 0/var(--tw-text-opacity));\">ften seems tired, burnt-out, and stressed. It's ironic to say that in our college, the reason is almost never the workload, study hours, or the bulky curriculum (unless you are a resident, intern, or in your final year). The library is well-crowded the day preceding the day of exams, while on the day following the exam day, there are rare faces, hardly three or four. Very few stand out as actual nerds in a niche of bespectacled individuals who are perceived as \"nerds\" in the society they come from.</span></p><p><br></p><p>The first two years of medical college are like navigating through an ocean. I wish I could say the ocean of knowledge. But the ocean I'm referring to is full of human emotions, puzzled between knowing whom to trust and whom not to. Medical school exposes us to many brilliant minds ( exactly a hundred in my class) and even more competition. It feels like there are a lot of unsaid rules. You need to be well-spoken, know more people, and have a good equation with each one of them. A lot more to follow!</p><p><br></p><p>The pride of entering a medical school almost always remains fresh, even if you realize everyone else is equally successful and right. Everyone wishes to be like an emperor in a seminar full of kings hailing from different kingdoms. Eventually, a superiority complex develops in each one of us, and half of the time, we keep on working just to satisfy our inner ego. Every now and then,&nbsp; the senior support&nbsp; looks terrible . You are taken into a project if and only if you belong to a certain political alliance. You are offered to co-author a research article not based on the your academic endeavors or your enthusiasm on the same, but based on how good in relation you are with the original researcher. Campus politics play a significant role in affecting mental health, making you feel extremely insignificant.</p><p><br></p><p>It's either you can't apply to a club of your interest, or you will be rejected from the interview you felt like you aced. The problem is open, and everyone knows about it. It makes up about half of the conversation we have at our college. Nepotism is criticized in the first two years as a junior, while it's loved to the core when you get to be a senior. The one in power always looks powerless.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The power imbalance and the medical school culture has been a major threat to mental health of young minds in their late teens and early twenties.
